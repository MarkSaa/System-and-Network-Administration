This project is about general networking.
You will be asked about existing configurations. 
In general the answers to the questions can be found on the machine for
which you are an administrator.
No root priviledges should be necessary to answer any of the questions.

Questions about network drivers.
(visit {\ltt{}drivers/net} in the kernel source code)

1) Support for several types of 3-Com (3cXXX) Ethernet cards are available
for the Linux kernel, list 4 such cards.

cd /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/ethernet/3com
ls

3c509.c 
3c59x.c
3c515.c  
3c589_cs.c

2) List 3 Intel Ethernet drivers. 

cd /usr/src/linux/drivers/net/ethernet/intel
ls

e100.c
e100.mod.c
e100.0

% 3) On a Parallel line cable running PLIP, what is pin 25 used for?
3) On a Parallel line cable running PLIP, what are pins 18,19 and 20 used for?

Pins 18, 19, 20 are gounds

Questions about configuration of TCP/IP.
(examine the front of your machine, also run the ifconfig and netstat commands)

4) Use a command to find out the fully qualified hostname of your machine?
What is the fully qualified hostname and what command did you use to find this out?

hostname --fqdn
lab70.net.cecs.csulb.edu

5) What is the hardware (ethernet) address of your machine?

ifconfig eth0

ether 00:22:4d:4c:79:75

6) What does it use for its broadcast address?

ifconfig eth0

broadcast 134.139.248.95

7) The routing table for your machine contains one gateway entry.
What is that entry?

route

default         jaguar.net.cecs 0.0.0.0         UG    1      0        0 eth0

8) What netmask does the loopback interface use?

route

loopback        *               255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo

Question about arp.  Ping two other of the lab machines. 

9) What entries are in the arp table?
Give the full entries including the hardware addresses.

--on jaguar--

arp -n
Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask	Iface
134.139.248.81           ether   e8:40:f2:05:e6:35   C		eth2
134.139.248.78           ether   00:22:4d:4c:78:9f   C		eth2

134.139.248.75           ether   00:22:4d:4c:79:25   C		eth2

Questions about the resolver. 
Examine {\ltt{}/etc/resolv.conf} and {\ltt{}/etc/nsswitch.conf};
 read the manual entry for {\ltt{}resolv.conf}.

10) What methods (NIS, DNS/bind, hosts file) does your machine use
to locate a hostname and in what order?

--on cheetah--

vim /etc/nsswitch.conf

hosts: files dns

11) What other machine does your machine use for DNS (resolver)?

vim /etc/resolv.conf

nameserver 134.139.248.17

12) Your machine allows certain other machines to be accessed without
typing the entire (fully qualified) host name. Which hostnames can
be accessed using this shorthand.

*net.cecs.csulb.edu
*cecs.csulb.edu
*coe.csulb.edu
*csulb.edu

Questions about the route table on {\ltt{}panther}.

13) What two gateways (routers) does {\ltt{}panther} know about?

--in panther--
route

Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         cheetah.cecs.cs 0.0.0.0         UG    1      0        0 eth0
134.139.248.32  jaguar.net.cecs 255.255.255.224 UG    0      0        0 eth0


14) What route entry on {\ltt{}panther} allows {\ltt{}panther}
to talk to the machine you administer?
Hint: what network address and subnet mask is your machine part of

route

network address: 134.139.248.64
subtnet mask: 255.255.255.224


Questions about netmasks.

15) A machine has internet number {\ltt{} 134.139.43.56}
and netmask {\ltt{} 255.255.255.0};
give its subnet number (network name) and subnet broadcast address.

subnet number: 134.139.43.0
broadcast address: 134.139.43.255


16) A machine has internet number {\ltt{} 134.139.201.134}
and netmask {\ltt{} 255.255.255.224};
give its subnet number (network name) and subnet broadcast address.

subnet number: 134.139.201.128
broadcast address: 134.139.201.159
